# jsmarc
JS Marc is a Vanilla-JS utility designed by Cl√©ment Corbin. It provides parsing, filtering and extracting capabilities over MARC records in the browser, client-side.
These features are provided through three web workers, allowing multi-threading to improve performance when working on large amounts of data.
